This folder contains the base programs and their needed tools for KAE kubernetes cluster

you are expected to follow the instructions from the company confluence page, but feel free to play around with the documentation

state.sh is a simple shell script that shows some basic information of the cluster (namespaces, nodes, pods, services so on...)

Tip: after pulling this repository dont forget to configure the state.sh to match the location of your kubeconfig file.
